          Sellr lets you create an online store you can easily run. Add and
          remove products and web pages, email your customers, accept cards,

          I didn't want to post this one, but it's Bill's favorite. Whenever
          your mad at your next family get together, just go here, and think,
          “At least we are not the Smith's.”

          This website is a calculator for duration between dates, helpful if
          you want to know things like how many days have past since your last
          birthday, or run a countdown on your website.

          By far my favorite. Have you ever called customer service to not only
          be greeted by a robot, but looped through a system of choices and
          confusing ways to reach your intended party? Well the bypass automated
          system in any company to talk to a human exists and this site helps
          you hack around that annoying system for any company on their list.

          Meditate and relax, that the purpose of this site. Enter a thought.
          Then click done. Then follow instructions and “woo saaa” you're not
          going to slap that person silly.
